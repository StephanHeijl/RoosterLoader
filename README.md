RoosterLoader
=============

RoosterLoader is the Python application running on Cytosine.nl that provides HAN
Students with a custom interface to their school schedules. It scrapes the information from the appropiate faculty source (currently enabled for FTK/IAS) and caches the data to provide fast resolutions for inquiring servers. The schedules are served in CSV or iCal format, as well as being dynamically available via a webcal link.
